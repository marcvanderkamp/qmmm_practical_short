You can use VMD to visualise this reaction. Open up
a new VMD window. Now you must tell VMD to change into the directory that contains
your simulation output files. Find the VMD command window
(the one that has <tt>VMD&gt;</tt> prompt). Change directory
by typing
</p>

<tt>
cd O:/Downloads/qmmm/QMMM
</tt>

<p>
This above command assumes your files are in O:\Downloads\qmmm\QMMM.
If they are not, you will need to use the directory you are using above.
</p>

<p>
Once you have changed into the right directory, you can see the files
by typing <tt>dir</tt>. If your files are listed, then you are in
the right directory. If not, then get a demonstrator to help you.
</p>

<p>
You can now play the reaction by typing
</p>

<tt>
play reaction.vmd
</tt>

<p>
within the VMD command window (the one with
<tt>VMD&gt;</tt> in it). This will load up all of the snapshots for
each value of the reaction coordinate from your minimisation
calculations. These will be loaded up as a movie, allowing you
to play the reaction backwards and forwards (use the play icons
at the bottom of the VMD main window). Describe the
structural changes that you observe during the reaction. Are
there any structural changes in the enzyme?
</p>

<p>
This simulation calculated the reaction energy profile by performing
an energy minimisation at several different values of the reaction
coordinate. The values used were -1.8, -1.5, -1.2, -0.9, -0.6, -0.3,
0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5 and 1.8. This maps from chorismate
 (at R = -1.8) through the transition state to prephrenate (
at R = +1.8).
</p>

<p>
However, the minimisations 
were not performed in this order (see slides).
To get the energies in the order of the forward reaction (from -1.8 to 1.8), you can run:
</p>
<tt>
sh get_energies
</tt>

<p>

<p>
This will generate a file called <b>energies.txt</b>. 
</p>
<p>
Load this file into a spreadsheet (e.g. use Excel: Data->From Text/CSV) to get a table with: reaction coordinate (R) values, number of minimisation steps,
total QM/MM energies (QM/MM energy) and the energies of the molecule only (QM only energy).
</p>

<p>
Calculate relative energies by setting chorismate (R = -1.8) to zero
(subtract the energy of chorismate from the energies from every other
value of R)
</p>

<p>
Plot the potential energy profile (the relative energies vs.
R value).
</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>
 
</p>


<b>IF you are interested</b>, you can find out the order of the minimisations 
taking a look at the <b>adiabatic_path.log</b> output file. Look 
for the lines that look like;
</p>

<tt>
CHARMM>    set R -0.3 <br>
Parameter: R <- "-0.3"
</tt>

<p>
These lines show how the value of the reaction coordinate (represented
by "R") is being set to a particular value, in this case -0.3.
</p>

<p>
You may also need to look for lines that look like this;
</p>

<tt>
CHARMM>    DECR R by 0.3 <br>
Parameter: R <- "-0.6"
</tt>

<p>
In this case, the reaction coordinate (R) is being decremented by 0.3, which (given
that is was -0.3) means that R is now equal to -0.6.
</p>

<p>
After each point where R is set to a new value, CHARMM then performed an energy minimisation.
There were several steps of minimisation. The final, minimum energy for that value of R
is reported on lines that look like this;

<p>
The line that starts with <tt>ABNR&gt;</tt> is the interesting one - this has the number
of energy minimisation steps (in this case 36), then the final minimum QM/MM energy of the 
value of the system (in this case -3750.43050) as the first two numbers.
The unit of energy used in CHARMM is <b>kcal/mole</b>.
</p>

<p>
Extract the total QM/MM energy and the number of minimisation steps, 
for each value of the reaction coordinate (R), from the output file from 
step 1.3 (adiabatic_path.log). You can either do this by hand, or you
can use the command;
</p>

<tt>
grep "ABNR&gt;" adiabatic_path.log
</tt>

<p>
to print all of the lines that start with <tt>ABNR&gt;"</tt>. Remember though
that these lines are printed in the order that the minimisations were performed,
and <b>do not</b> appear in the order -1.8,-1.5,...,0.0,...1.5,1.8.
