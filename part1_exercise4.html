<H2>Part 1: QM/MM Simulations</H2>
<H3>Exercise 4 - The Gas-Phase Reaction with QM Arg90</H3>
<HR noshade>

<p>
The final simulation to run is the calculate the reaction energies for going
from chorismate to prephenate in the gas-phase, while
bound to a solitary Arg90 residue (modelled using QM).
</p>

<p>
The input script is qm_r90qm.inp. You will need to modify it to set the R variable in the 
beginning to do the calculation for the values of the reaction coordinate that correspond to the reactant (-1.8), 
transition state (-0.3) and product (1.8). Do this by editing the file by typing <tt>write qm_r90qm.inp</tt> and
saving three different files, one for each of the three values of the reaction coordinate.
</p>

<p>
For each of the three files, run a CHARMM simulation. Do this by typing;

<pre>
./charmm < FILENAME.inp > FILENAME.log
</pre>

where FILENAME is the name of the file, e.g. if you have named the file for the reactant <tt>qm_r90qm_-1.8.inp</tt>,
then you would need to type;

<pre>
./charmm < qm_r90qm_-1.8.inp > qm_r90qm_-1.8.log
</pre>
