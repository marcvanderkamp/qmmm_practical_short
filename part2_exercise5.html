<H3>Exercise 3 - Looking for Correlation</H3>
<HR noshade>

<p>
From <a href="part2_exercise2.html">Part 2, exercise 2</a> you calculated a 
stabilisation energy. You also
calculated the barrier height of the reaction (the relative energy
at the transition state in <a href="part2_exercise1.html">Part 2, exercise 1</a>). 
The final part of this practical is to 
examine whether or not there is any correlation of these values.
</p>

<p>
Open the spreadsheet file <b>correlation.xls</b>. This is a list
of barrier heights and stabilisation energies from several other snapshots
from the original molecular dynamics simulation. Copy the values from
this spreadsheet into your spreadsheet. Add the barrier height
and stabilisation energy that you calculated to this list, then plot
stabilisation energy versus barrier height. Is there any correlation?
Calculate the correlation coefficient (R^2). What does any correlation or
lack of correlation imply? How well do your results fit with the 
results from other snapshots?
