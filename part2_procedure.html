<H2>Part 2: Investigating the Role of Arginine 90</H2>
<H3>Procedure</H3>
<HR noshade>

<p>
You will investigate the role that Arg90 plays during the enzyme catalysed 
reaction. You will do this by including the side chain of Arg90 within 
the QM region of the simulation. You will then calculate the energy of the system
for values of the reaction coordinate that correspond 
to the transition state, the reactant and the product. You will do this 
both for the enzyme-catalysed reaction, and for the gas-phase.
</p>

<p>
Adding the side chain of Arg90 to the QM region will however introduce a problem.
The problem is that part of Arg90 will be QM, while another part will be
MM. This means that the interface between the QM and MM atoms now crosses
a carbon-carbon bond. This means that the carbon on the QM side of the interface
is missing its bonded atom. This carbon now does not have a full coordination 
sphere. To remedy this, you have to refill the coordination sphere by adding
a non-physical "link atom". This atom typically behaves like hydrogen (can
you think why?), and it must be placed along the carbon-carbon bond.
In this part of the practical you will add the side chain of Arg90 to
the QM region, and will then add a link atom along the broken
carbon-carbon bond.
</p>

<p>
<b>qmmm_r90qm.inp</b> is a script that does calculates the energy
of the system for the enzyme-catalysed reaction with a given 
value of the reaction coordinate. It is now set up to run with 
chorismate in the QM-region only. You will adjust it so that 
it will also include the side-chain of the catalytic Arg90 in 
the QM-region and will add a link atom along the carbon-carbon
bond at the interface of the QM and MM regions
(edit the file by typing "write qmmm_r90qm.inp").
</p>

<p>
Modifications of input-script:

<ul>
<li>
Add definition of QQ atom type (link-atom)
</li>
<li>
Read in parameters for link-atom, linkatom27.prm
</li>
<li>
Add link-atom between CG and CD of Arg90 
(use the ADDLinkatom command)
</li>
<li>
Add extra atoms to QUANTUM definition
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This script is set up to write out a crd-file for the QM-region 
only. You will need to modify the script so that it includes 
Arg90 in that output. To do so, you should adjust the selection 
for atom deletion so that the Arg90 side-chain is NOT deleted.
</p>

<h3>
There are extensive instructions in the script that tell you
how to perform the above modifications. Please read these
instructions before calling for a demonstrator.
</h3>

<p>
The instructions are all indicated by the lines that 
start with a <tt>!! ##</tt>, e.g
</p>

<tt>
<pre>
!! ## Read parameters for link-atom - do this by
!! ## uncommenting the below line. Look at this file.
!! ## Can you work out what information is contained in 
!! ## this file?
</pre>
</tt>

<p>
In this case, the line below this instruction;
</p>

<tt>
<pre>
!read para card name linkatom27.prm append
</pre>
</tt>

<p>
is commented out (all lines that start with a <tt>!</tt> are ignored
by CHARMM - they are "commented out"). In this case, all you need to 
do is remove the <tt>!</tt> so that CHARMM is no longer ignoring this line.
</p>

<p>
Further down in the file you will see that you need to modify the definitions
of the quantum regions by adding atoms. To do this you will need to get the 
identification of the atoms you wish to add. To do this, you can use VMD. You
will be shown how to do this during the practical, or alternatively, ask a 
demonstrator for help.
