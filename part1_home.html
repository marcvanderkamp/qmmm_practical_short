<H2>Part 1: QM/MM Simulations</H2>
<HR noshade>

<p>
We will be using a molecular dynamics program called CHARMM. CHARMM is <b>not</b> a nice
and friendly program, but it is very powerful, and is one of the few programs
that is capable of performing the QM/MM simulations that we need to perform to
investigate enzyme catalysis. We shall also be using the VMD molecular visualisation
program to view the structure of the enzyme and to follow the reaction 
graphically.
</p>

<p>
In these exercises you will use CHARMM and VMD to model the enzyme catalysed
reaction of chorismate to prephenate in the enzyme, and will then compare
this reaction by running simulations of the reaction in the gas-phase.
We shall use VMD to look at the changes in structure of the enzyme during
the reaction, and shall also see how the simulations can be used to
quantify the catalytic power of the enzyme.
