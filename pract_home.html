<p>
This practical is divided into two sessions;

<ol>
<li>
In the first session, you will run all of the QM/MM simulations that are needed
to model the reaction of chorismate to prephenate. You will model this reaction
four times; 
<ol type="i">
<li>while bound in the active site in the enzyme, chorismate mutase</li>
<li>without the enzyme or solvent (in the 'gas-phase')</li>
</ol></li>

<li>
In the second session, you will analyse the output from all of the simulations
to create graphs showing how the energy changes as the reaction progresses.
This will allow you to work out how the enzyme affects the activation
energy of the reaction, and to investigate how the enzyme is able to
catalyse the reaction.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
To complete this practical you must follow all of the steps and complete 
all of the exercises, keeping a record of everything that you are asked to produce.
