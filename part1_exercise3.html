<H3>Exercise 2 - Gas Phase Reaction</H3>
<HR noshade>

<p>
The next step is to calculate the reaction energies for going from 
chorismate to prephenate in the gas-phase. To do this, you must 
extract the coordinates of the substrate from the minimised 
conformations obtained from exercise 1 (which means that the
simulation run in exercise 1 <b>must</b> have finished successfully
before you can perform this exercise!)
</p>

<p>
Do this by running the command;

<pre>
sh get_qmonly
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Run energy calculations of QM atoms only along the profile using the command; 

<pre>
./charmm < qmonly_ener.inp > qmonly_ener.log
</pre>

(This will take less than a minute)
