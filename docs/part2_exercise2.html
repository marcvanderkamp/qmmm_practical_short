<p>
The next step is to look at the QM energies of the reaction from 
chorismate to prephenate in the gas-phase.  
</p>

<p>
The energies should already be present in <b>energies.txt</b>, and thus loaded into the spreadsheet in the previous step. 
</p>

<p>
<b>IF you are interested</b>, the energies were calculated in Part 1, exercise 2, and are in <t>qmonly_ener.log</t>.
Note that in this case, the energies will be printed in the correct order
(so from -1.8, through 0.0, up to +1.8)
</p>

<p>
You can extract the minimised QM energy of the reaction, either by using grep; 

<pre>
grep "ENER QUANTM>" qmonly_ener.log
</pre>

or by extracting values manually.
</p>

<p>
Once the values are in your spreadsheet, calculate the relative 
energies (as you did in <a href="part2_exercise1.html">exercise 1</a>). Plot the relative energies
on the same graph that you produced in <a href="part2_exercise1.html">exercise 1</a>. Calculate the stabilisation 
energy (relative QM gas-phase energy from this step minus 
relative QM/MM energy from <a href="part2_exercise1.html">exercise 1</a>). The stabilisation energy
is the difference between the reaction energy for the gas-phase
reaction and the reaction energy for the enzyme catalysed reaction.
The stabilisation energy shows by how much the enzyme is 
stabilising the reaction, and which parts of the reaction 
are being stabilised.
</p>

<p>
Plot the stabilisation energy against the reaction coordinate. Does your graph show support for 
the hypothesis that chorismate mutase catalyses the reaction by 
stabilising the transition state?
