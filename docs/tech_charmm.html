<H2>The CHARMM QM/MM Molecular Dynamics Program</H2>
<HR noshade>

<P>
To run this practical you will need to use the CHARMM QM/MM molecular dynamics
program (see <a href="http://www.charmm.org">www.charmm.org</a>). CHARMM is a very
powerful program that is used every day in the Centre for Computational Chemistry
to investigate enzyme reaction mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
CHARMM is a command line program, meaning that you run it from a command line,
passing it an input file, and it will then write an output file. You run
CHARMM via the command;
</p>

<p>
<tt>
charmm < inputfile.inp > outputfile.log
</tt>
</p>

<p>
Do NOT write
</p>
<p>
<tt>
charmm < inputfile.inp > inputfile.inp
</tt>
</p>

<p>
as this will overwrite your input file! If you do this you will then need
to ask a demonstrator to help you restore your original file.
</p>

<p>
If something is wrong with the input file, or something goes wrong while
running CHARMM, then the program will exit, and a skull and crossbones
will be printed at the end of the output file. Please always check
to see there isn't a skull and crossbones at the end of your files,
because if there is, then there is probably a typo in your script,
or CHARMM is just having a bad day ;-).
</p>

<p>
The full documentation for CHARMM can be found 
<a href="http://www.charmm.org/documentation/c32b2/index.html">here</a>.
You will mainly be using the following commands in this practical;

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.charmm.org/documentation/c32b2/minimiz.html">MINI (minimise)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.charmm.org/documentation/c32b2/qmmm.html">QUANTUM</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.charmm.org/documentation/c32b2/select.html">SELE (selection)</a></li>
</ul>
