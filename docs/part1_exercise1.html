<H3>Exercise 1 - Enzyme Catalysed Reaction with MM Arg90</H3>
<HR noshade>

<p>
Run a series of minimisations along the reaction coordinate
of the enzyme-catalysed reaction using the input script
<b>adiabatic_path.inp</b>. You will need to modify this
input script (TWICE!) so that it uses the starting structure
that you chose. <b>Comments (lines starting with "!!") in the
input script will guide you.</b></br> 
You can edit the input script by typing:

<pre>
write adiabatic_path.inp
</pre>
</p>

<p>
You will run this minimisation on your desktop, using CHARMM.
To run the simulation, type;

<pre>
./charmm < adiabatic_path.inp > adiabatic_path.log
</pre>

This will produce an output file called "adiabatic_path.log"
which contains the output of the simulation. Additional structure
files will also be created that represent snapshots along the 
reaction.
</p>

<p>
The minimisations should take about 10-20 minutes to run. You should move
on to the next exercise while this is running. While the minimisation
is running, you won't be able to type into the command window. You must 
open a new command window to allow you to move on to the next section.
</p>

<p>
CHARMM will let you know if there are any problems running the simulation by printing a skull and 
crossbones at the bottom of the output file. If you don't see
the skull and crossbones, then the simulation probably worked!
