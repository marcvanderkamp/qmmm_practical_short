<H2>Techniques Used in This Practical</H2>
<HR noshade>

<P>This practical is computer-based. To carry it out properly, you will need
to be able to use a number of computer programs, as detailed below. If you are
familiar with all of them, you can skip this section and get down to work. 
Otherwise, read the info. below and on the linked pages. You will
probably at least want to glance at the <I>CHARMM</I> and <I>VMD</I> sections.</P>

<LI><A HREF="tech_cmdline.html"><B>Command Line</B></A>. You will be running all of
the programs by using the MSYS command line.</LI>

<LI><A HREF="tech_vmd.html"><B>VMD</B></A>. VMD is a molecular viewer program
that you can use to display 3D models of molecules.</LI>

<LI><A HREF="tech_charmm.html"><B>CHARMM</B></A>. CHARMM is a very powerful,
if difficult to use(!) molecular dynamics and structure optimisation
program that is capable of performing QM/MM simulations of enzymes.</LI>
