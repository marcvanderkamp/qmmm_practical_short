<H2>Part 1: QM/MM Simulations</H2>
<H3>Procedure</H3>
<HR noshade>

<p>
You will be running a QM/MM simulation of the enzyme-catalysed 
reaction of chorismate to prephenate. The substrate (chorismate) 
will be modelled using QM, while the enzyme (chorismate mutase) 
and solvating water will be modelled using MM. The reaction will 
be simulated by shortening the bond between atoms C3 and C9 of 
chorismate, while increasing the bond length between C and O3. 
The difference between these bond lengths will be the reaction 
coordinate (RC). You will run a QM/MM simulation that will change 
this reaction coordinate from -1.8 A to +1.8 A, minimising the 
system, and then calculating the energy, for each value.
</p>

<p>
You will be running the program on your desktop computer. The input files are
contained in the zip file that you can download from 
<a href="secure/qmmm.zip">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Use 'Right-click' and 'Save as..' to save it to a specific location, e.g. your O:\Downloads\ directory.
</p>    
    
<p>
To unpack this file, right click on it and select "Extract". This will 
unpack the file into the directory you saved the zip file in (e.g. the downloads directory in your O drive).
You need to have to have enough space to unpack the files and run the practical - you will
need at least 35 MB.
</p>

<p>
You will be using the MSYS command line environment to run the CHARMM program and other commands during this practical.
</p>
<p>
    For Windows 10:
Start MSYS by searching for "msys" with the looking-glass button, which will bring up MSYS 1.0.11; click on this "Desktop App".
</p>
<p>
    For Windows 7 or similar:
    You can start MSYS by pressing the Start Button, followed by Run...
</p>
<p>
Then type:
</p>
<pre>  C:/msys/1.0/msys.bat
</pre>

<p>
In the MSYS window, change into the directory containing the files for this first part of the practical.
If the files are in O:\Downloads\qmmm\QMMM then do this by typing;

<pre>
cd /o/Downloads/qmmm/QMMM
</pre>

Use <tt>ls</tt> to list files in this 
directory.
</p>

<p>
A starting structure for this practical can be found on <a href="structures.html">this page</a>. 
This page contains several snapshot structures from a molecular dynamics simulation of 
chorismate mutase. Each snapshot is numbered. Choose one of these snapshots (making 
sure to choose a different number than your neighbours) and download
the min_ts&lt;favourite number&gt;.crd and min_ts&lt;favourite number&gt;.pdb files
to the top directory for the practical (e.g. /o/Downloads/qmmm/QMMM).
</p>


<p>
The starting structures were obtained from a simulation of the 
transition state of the enzyme-catalysed reaction. The starting 
structure is a snapshot from that simulation. Use VMD to visualise the 
structure of the enzyme and transition state. Do this by loading 
the min_ts&lt;favourite number&gt;.pdb file into VMD, and use the 
"Graphical Representations" form (under Graphics|Representations) 
to highlight chorismate mutase (type <tt>segid MA MB MC</tt>
into the "selected atoms" box of the "Graphical Representations" window), 
the transition state of chorismate to prephenate (click "Create Rep" to
create a new representation, then type <tt>segid CH</tt> into the 
"selected atoms" box of the "Graphical Representations" window) and 
the Arg90 residue in the active site 
(click "Create Rep" again, and type <tt>resid 90 and within 10.0 of segid CH</tt>
into the "selected atoms" box).  Identify the bonds 
that correspond to the reaction coordinate.
