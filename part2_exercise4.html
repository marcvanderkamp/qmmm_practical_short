<H2>Part 2: Analysis of the Results</H2>
<H3>Exercise 4 - Gas phase reaction with bound solitary Arg90 (QM)</H3>
<HR noshade>

<p>
In exercises <a href="part2_exercise1.html">1</a> and 
<a href="part2_exercise2.html">2</a>, you calculated stabilisation energies by comparing the 
reaction profile of the reaction of chorismate to prephenate in the enzyme
against the reaction in the gas phase. To provide a similar comparison
for the reaction of chorismate to prephenate in the enzyme with a QM Arg90,
it is necessary to calculate the reaction profile of the gas phase reaction
bound next to a solitary QM Arg90.

<p>
Extract the total energies of the reactant, transition
state and product via 
</p>

<tt>
grep "ENER QUANTM>" &lt;output_file_name&gt;.log
</tt>

<p>
(where
&lt;output_file_name&gt;.log is the name of the output
files you have used in <a href="part1_exercise4.html">part 1, exercise 4</a>, e.g.
<tt>qm_r90qm_-1.8.log</tt>). Place these
energies into your spreadsheet and calculate relative energies as
in <a href="part2_exercise1.html">Part 2, exercise 1</a>. Plot these relative energies on the 
graph produced in <a href="part2_exercise1.html">Part 2, exercise 1</a>.
</p>

<p>
Calculate the stabilisation energy (gas-phase with QM Arg90 relative
energy minus enzyme with QM Arg90 relative energy).  Plot the stabilisation
energy on the graph you produced in <a href="part2_exercise2.html">Part 2, exercise 2</a>. 
How does the stabilisation 
compare to that calculated in <a href="part2_exercise2.html">Part 2, exercise 2</a>. What does this indicate 
about the role of Arg90 during catalysis.  Include your reasoning.
