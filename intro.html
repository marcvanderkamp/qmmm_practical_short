<p>
In this practical, you will learn how to apply combined 
quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods to model a 
chemical reaction in an enzyme. You will calculate energy profiles 
for the reaction, and analyse important interactions at the active site. 
The results will be used to examine transition state stabilization in 
the enzyme.

<ul>
  <li><b>Aims of the Experiment</b>
    <ul>
      <li>How to model biological systems, specifically, proteins - 
         and how to use QM/MM methods to model enzyme-catalysed chemical reactions.</li>  

      <li>How to understand catalysis in terms of changes in activation energy, and how to rationalise changes in 
          activation energy in terms of interactions between molecules (in this case, between the enzyme and the 
          substrate)..</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Methods Used</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Use of CHARMM, a key piece of computational chemistry software that is commonly used to model enzyme-catalysed reactions</li>
      <li>Structural and energetic analysis of reaction paths and comparison of calculations and experimental data.
</li>
    </ul>

  <li><b>Systems Studied</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Reaction of chorismate to prephenate catalysed by the enzyme
          chorismate mutase, in the condensed phase.</li>
      <li>Reaction of chorismate to prephenate in the gas-hase</li>
