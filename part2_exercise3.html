<H2>Part 2: Analysis of the Results</H2>
<H3>Exercise 3 - Enzyme Catalysed Reaction with QM Arg90</H3>
<HR noshade>

<p>
In <a href="part1_exercise1.html">exercise 1 of the first session</a>
you simulated the reaction of chorismate to prephenate while bound
to the enzyme chorismate mutase.
</p>

<p>
In <a href="part1_exercise2.html">exercise 2 of the first session</a>
you repeated the simulation, but this time, one of the residues of
chorismate mutase (Arg90) was modelled using QM, rather than MM.
</p>  

<p>
In this exercise you will calculate the reaction profile when Arg90 
in chorismate mutase is modelled using QM.
</p>

<p>
Extract the total energy of the reactant, transition state and product structures by using

<pre>
grep "ENER&gt;" qmmm_r90qm_reactant.log
</pre>

<pre>
grep "ENER&gt;" qmmm_r90qm_ts.log
</pre>

<pre>
grep "ENER&gt;" qmmm_r90qm_product.log
</pre>

</p>

<p>Place the energies
in your spreadsheet, and calculate the relative energies,
as in <a href="part2_exercise1.html">part 2, exercise 1</a>. Plot the relative energies
on the same graph you produced in <a href="part2_exercise1.html">part 2, exercise 1</a>.
