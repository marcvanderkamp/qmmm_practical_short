<H2>Dealing with Problems</H2>
<hr noshade>

<P>Working with chemicals on a computer is often as frustrating as working
with them in the lab - computers don't work, programs crash, they don't
finish, they produce apparently silly output. Don't panic ! These things
happen. Take a deep breath, stand up and rest your eyes & brain, do something
else for a few minutes.</P>

<P>If you are having a problem with using the 
<A target=mainpage href="tech_cmdline.html">
command line</A>, with <A target=mainpage href="tech_charmm.html">CHARMM</A>,
or with
<A target=mainpage href="tech_vmd.html">VMD</A>, take a look at the
corresponding Technical Details page. Get someone else to look at your changes
to the input files - often you can't see an error if you've been gazing at it
for too long.</P>

<P>If you are having a "scientific" problem, re-read the <A target=mainpage
href="bg.html">Background</A> page, and maybe take a look at the references
included in the Further Reading Sections. Have a think. Try again.</P>

<P>If you still have problems, ASK! If this is after the practical/workshop, you can email  <a href="mailto:Marc.vanderKamp@bristol.ac.uk">me</a>.

<P>Incidentally, if you think something is really unclear, or wrong, or inappropriate,
or inacceptable, etc. etc., <B>Let Me Know !!!</B> The easiest way
to do this is to email <a href="mailto:Marc.vanderKamp@bristol.ac.uk">me</a>.
